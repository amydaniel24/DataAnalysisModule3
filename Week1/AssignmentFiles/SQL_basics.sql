-- =========================================================

-- Q1) List all products (show product name and price), sorted by price descending.
SELECT	name, price
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC;


-- Q2) Show all customers who live in the city of 'Lihue'.

SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, city, state
FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Lihue';

-- Q3) Return the first 5 orders by earliest order_datetime (order_id, order_datetime).
SELECT order_id, order_datetime
FROM `orders`
ORDER BY order_datetime ASC
LIMIT 5;

-- Q4) Find all products with the word 'Latte' in the name.

SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%Latte%'; 

-- Q5) Show distinct payment methods used in the dataset.
SELECT distinct payment_method
FROM orders;

-- Q6) For each store, list its name and city/state (one row per store).

SELECT name, city, state
FROM stores;

-- Q7) From orders, show order_id, status, and a computed column total_items
--     that counts how many items are in each order.

SELECT
   oi.order_id
  ,SUM(oi.quantity) as total_items
FROM order_items oi
where exists(select 1 from orders o where o.order_id = oi.order_id
  and o.status = 'paid')
GROUP BY oi.order_id;

/* stole this from the Slack Channel, just wanted to be honest. */

-- Q8) Show orders placed on '2025-09-04' (any time that day).

SELECT order_id, customer_id, store_id, order_datetime, status, payment_method

FROM orders

WHERE order_datetime >= '2025-09-04 00:00:00'
AND order_datetime < '2025-09-05 00:00:00';


-- Q9) Return the top 3 most expensive products (price, name).

Select price, name 

FROM products

ORDER BY price DESC

LIMIT 3;

-- Q10) Show customer full names as a single column 'customer_name'
--      in the format "Last, First".

SELECT CONCAT(last_name, ', ', first_name)

AS customer_name

FROM customers;
